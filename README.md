# DirectXMesh geometry processing library

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=324981

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

**February 21, 2024**

This package contains DirectXMesh, a shared source library for performing various geometry content processing operations including generating normals and tangent frames, triangle adjacency computations, vertex cache optimization, and meshlet generation.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16.11), Visual Studio 2022, clang for Windows v12 or later, or MinGW 12.2. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK ([19041](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-may-2020-update-sdk/)) or later is required for Visual Studio. It can also be built for Windows Subsystem for Linux using GCC 11 or later.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://aka.ms/dxsdk).

## Directory Layout

* ``DirectXMesh\``

   + This contains the DirectXMesh library.

> The majority of the header files here are intended for  implementation the library only (``DirectXMeshP.h``, ``scoped.h``, etc.). Only ``DirectXMesh.h`` and ``DirectXMesh.inl`` are meant as a 'public' headers for the library.

* ``Utilities\``

  + This contains helper code related to mesh processing that is not general enough to be part of the DirectXMesh library.
    * ``WaveFrontReader.h``: Contains a simple C++ class for reading mesh data from a WaveFront OBJ file.

* ``Meshconvert\``

  + This DirectXMesh sample is an implementation of the ``meshconvert`` command-line texture utility from the legacy DirectX SDK utilizing DirectXMesh rather than D3DX.

> This tool does not support legacy ``.X`` files, but can export ``CMO``, ``SDKMESH``, and ``VBO`` files.

* ``build\``

  + Contains YAML files for the build pipelines along with some miscellaneous build files and scripts.

## Release Notes

* Starting with the June 2020 release, this library makes use of typed enum bitmask flags per the recommendation of the _C++ Standard_ section *17.5.2.1.3 Bitmask types*. This is consistent with Direct3D 12's use of the ``DEFINE_ENUM_FLAG_OPERATORS`` macro. This may have *breaking change* impacts to client code:

  * You cannot pass the ``0`` literal as your flags value. Instead you must make use of the appropriate default enum value: ``CNORM_DEFAULT``, ``VALIDATE_DEFAULT``, or ``MESHLET_DEFAULT``.

  * Use the enum type instead of ``DWORD`` if building up flags values locally with bitmask operations. For example, ```CNORM_FLAGS flags = CNORM_DEFAULT; if (...) flags |= CNORM_WIND_CW;```

* The UWP projects and the Win10 classic desktop project include configurations for the ARM64 platform. Building these requires installing the ARM64 toolset.

* When using clang/LLVM for the ARM64 platform, the Windows 11 SDK ([22000](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-for-windows-11/)) or later is required.
