DIRECTX MESH LIBRARY (DirectXMesh)
------------------------------------

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

September 22, 2017

This package contains DirectXMesh, a shared source library for performing various geometry
content processing operations including generating normals and tangent frames, triangle
adjacency computations, and vertex cache optimization.

The source is written for Visual Studio 2013, 2015, or 2017. It is recommended
that you make use of VS 2013 Update 5, VS 2015 Update 3, the latest VS 2017 update,
and Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the DirectX SDK. For details,
see "Where is the DirectX SDK?" <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee663275.aspx>.

DirectXMesh\
    This contains the DirectXMesh library.

    Note that the majority of the header files here are intended for internal implementation
    of the library only (DirectXMeshP.h and scoped.h). Only DirectXMesh.h is meant as a
    'public' header for the library.

Utilities\
    This contains helper code related to mesh processing that is not general enough to be
    part of the DirectXMesh library.

         WaveFrontReader.h - Contains a simple C++ class for reading mesh data from a WaveFront OBJ file.

Meshconvert\
    This DirectXMesh sample is an implementation of the "meshconvert" command-line texture utility
    from the DirectX SDK utilizing DirectXMesh rather than D3DX.

    Note this tool does not support legacy .X files, but can export CMO, SDKMESH, and VBO files.

RELEASE NOTES
-------------

* The VS 2017 projects make use of /permissive- for improved C++ standard conformance. Use of a Windows 10 SDK prior to
  the Fall Creators Update (16299) or an Xbox One XDK prior to June 2017 QFE 4 may result in failures due to problems
  with the system headers. You can work around these by deleting /permissive- from the project files which is found
  in the <AdditionalOptions> element.
